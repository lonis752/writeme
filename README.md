```markdown # TODO App (PERN Stack) ![Preview](insert-your-image-url-here) ## Description The **TODO App** is a simple yet powerful web application developed using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). This project allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tasks in a user-friendly interface. It serves as an excellent demonstration of how the PERN stack can be leveraged to build a full-stack application, showcasing both front-end and back-end development practices. This application is designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can easily keep track of what they need to do, prioritize their tasks, and mark them as complete when finished. The modular structure of the codebase and the use of modern frameworks make it a great learning tool for developers who are looking to understand how to integrate various technologies in web development. ## Core Features - **User Authentication**: Secure login/logout functionality to protect user data. - **Task Management**: Create, read, update, and delete tasks. - **Responsive Design**: A user-friendly interface that works well on various devices. - **Data Persistence**: Uses PostgreSQL for storing tasks in a robust database. - **RESTful API**: Built with Express.js to handle requests and serve data to the client seamlessly. - **Real-Time Updates**: React.js allows for dynamic updates without the need for page reloads. ## Tech Stack - **Frontend**: - React.js - Axios (for API calls) - Bootstrap (for styling) - **Backend**: - Node.js - Express.js - PostgreSQL (for the database) - Sequelize (as ORM) - **Development Tools**: - Git - npm/yarn ## Installation To get started with the TODO app, follow these steps to clone the repository: 1. **Clone the repository**: ```bash git clone https://github.com/lonis752/todo-PERN.git cd todo-PERN ``` 2. **Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies**: ```bash cd backend npm install ``` 3. **Setup your database**: - Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed. - Create your database. - Update your database configurations in the backend `.env` file. 4. **Run the server**: ```bash npm start ``` 5. **Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies**: ```bash cd ../frontend npm install ``` 6. **Run the React application**: ```bash npm start ``` Now you can access the TODO app on `http://localhost:3000`! ## Future Improvements While the TODO app provides a solid foundation for task management, there are many opportunities for enhancement: - **Implementing User Roles**: Enable different user roles (admin, user) to manage tasks differently. - **Task Due Dates**: Add an option for users to set due dates for tasks, along with reminders. - **Search and Filter**: Implement search and filter capabilities for easier task management. - **Progress Tracking**: Allow users to track the progress of each task visually. - **Unit and Integration Tests**: Build a robust test suite to ensure the reliability of the application. ## Contributing We welcome contributions from anyone interested in improving this project!
